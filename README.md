# VITYARTHI-Project
🇮🇳 Project: Army Inventory Management System
A Tactical Logistics Manager developed using Python. > By [Your Name] | B.Tech 1st Year Student

📜 Overview

Project  is a CLI (Command Line Interface) based application designed to simulate how an army commander manages resources across multiple base camps.
It helps in tracking inventory (Weapons, Rations, Medkits), calculating total asset value, and performing logistics transfers between bases. This project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts like Nested Dictionaries, Loops, and Conditional Logic.

🚀 Features

📍 Multi-Camp Management: Add new camps and organize inventory separately for each base.
💰 Budget Calculation: Automatically calculates the total monetary value of assets in each camp and the grand total for the whole army.
🔎 Global Intel (Search): Search for a specific item (e.g., "Rifles") across all camps instantly to see total availability.
🚚 Logistics Transfer: Move supplies from one camp to another. The system checks if the source camp has enough stock before moving it.
🛡️ Data Persistence (Session): Keeps track of data while the program is running.

🛠️ Technology Used

Language: Python 3.x

Concepts:

Nested Dictionaries (Data Structures)
Control Flow (If/Else)
Loops (For/While)
Input Validation
Mathematical Logic

💻 How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the .py file.
Run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
python army_manager.py


(Note: Replace army_manager.py with whatever you named your python file)

📸 Usage Example

1. Viewing Stock:

📍 Camp Alpha
   - Rifles: 50 units | Val: ₹10,00,000
   - Rations: 1000 units | Val: ₹50,000
💰 CAMP VALUE: ₹10,50,000


2. Transferring Supplies:

From Camp: Camp Alpha
To Camp: Camp Bravo
Item: Rifles
Quantity: 5
✅ TRANSFER COMPLETE: Moved 5 Rifles from Camp Alpha to Camp Bravo.


🔮 Future Improvements

Since I am currently in my 1st Year, I plan to update this project with:

[ ] File Handling: To save data permanently to a .txt or .csv file.
[ ] Authentication: Adding a password login system for the Commander.
[ ] GUI: Building a visual interface using Tkinter.
